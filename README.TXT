This is the Volleyball League project which simulates the Volleyball 
League. It has 3 divisions with 5 teams each. Each team plays 2 matches 
against the other teams in the same league. On winning a match a team 
gets points according to the number of sets they won plus 1 point for 
winning the match. The losing team gets points by the number of sets they
have won.

To start a project create an instance of the League class and call the 
simulateLeague() method.
